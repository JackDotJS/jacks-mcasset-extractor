# Jack's MCAsset Extractor
A dead-simple desktop application for extracting Minecraft's built-in assets.

### Q: what the heck is this?
A: This is a desktop application that simplifies the extraction of Minecraft's built-in assets. This includes things like textures, sounds, and more. Currently, this only includes the "hashed" assets you'll find in `./minecraft/assets/objects`, but I plan to add the ability to extract the assets included in Minecraft's .jar files in a later version. https://github.com/JackDotJS/jacks-mcasset-extractor/issues/3

### Q: where can i download it?
A: [Right here](https://github.com/JackDotJS/jacks-mcasset-extractor/releases), in the Releases page of this repository.

### Q: what do i need to run it?
A: Any version of Java 8 or newer. I personally recommend [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

### Q: what in the world do i need this for?
A: This tool is mostly useful for Resource Pack developers, especially those looking to acquire Minecraft's default sound files. Other than that, uhhh idk lmao

### Q: why is this code so terrible?
A: While this tool has a legitmate purpose and function, it's also mostly a way for me to try learning Java. Quite literally, this is my first Java program ever. Up to this point, I've only ever been familiar with JavaScript (both web and Node.JS), and I wanted to start expanding into other languages as a way to challenge myself, *and* maybe to have the skills required to work on even more, larger projects someday... :eyes:
